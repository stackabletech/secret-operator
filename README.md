[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg)](https://GitHub.com/stackabletech/secret-operator/graphs/commit-activity)

This is a Kubernetes Operator to provision and inject secrets for Kubernetes pods. Compared to Kubernetes' native secret mounts, this permits secrets to be selected dynamically based on properties of the `Pod`.

It is written by [Stackable](https://www.stackable.tech) in Rust.

The documentation for this operator can be found at https://docs.stackable.tech/secret-operator/stable/index.html.
