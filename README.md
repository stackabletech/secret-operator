<!-- Abstract -->

The Secret Operator by [Stackable](https://stackable.tech/).
This is a Kubernetes Operator to provision and inject secrets for Kubernetes Pods. It is part of the [Stackable Data Platform](https://stackable.tech/), a curated selection of the best open source data apps like Kafka, Druid, Trino or Spark, all working together seamlessly. Based on Kubernetes, it runs everywhere â€“ on prem or in the cloud.

## Quickstart

The best way to get started with this operator (and the platform) is to use `stackablectl`. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/stackabletech/stackablectl/releases) and have a look at the [docs](https://docs.stackable.tech/stackablectl/stable/index.html).

You can install this operator by running:

```
stackablectl operator install secret
```

See it in action in one of our [Demos](https://stackable.tech/en/demos/).

## What does it do?

The Secret Operator provisions and mounts secrets, but unlike the default Kubernetes Secret mechanism, Secrets can be created and mouted dynamically based on Pod properties. The Operator supports:

- Generating TLS certificates on demand and mounting them
- Handling XYZ
- And something else

## How it works

The Secret Operator is deployed as a DaemonSet and provides a CSI to mount files directly into Pods.

## About The Stackable Data Platform

This operator is written and maintained by [Stackable](https://www.stackable.tech) and it is part of a larger platform. It is used by the other Operators to - for example - provision TLS certificates for secure traffic.
