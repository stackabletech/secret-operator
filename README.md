This is a Kubernetes Operator to provision and inject secrets for Kubernetes pods. Compared to Kubernetes' native secret mounts, this permits secrets to be selected dynamically
based on properties of the `Pod`.

It is written by [Stackable](https://www.stackable.de) in Rust.

The documentation for this operator can be found at https://docs.stackable.tech/secret-operator/index.html.
