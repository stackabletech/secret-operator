# secret-operator

Manages/generates Kubernetes secrets, and mounts them into pods using CSI

## Running

The operator must be executed inside Kubernetes, since it registers a CSI plugin against Kubelet.

Secret-operator can be built with either `docker build` or [Nix](https://nixos.org/). `docker build` is currently our primary deployment target, and our
official images are built using it. However, Nix has much faster build and deploy times, making it ideal for local development.

### Docker

To build and deploy to the active Kind cluster, run:

```bash
# Ensure that all submodules are up-to-date
$ git submodule update --recursive --init
# Update the Chart metadata and CRD definitions
$ make compile-chart
# Create a unique image ID
$ REPO=secret-operator
$ TAG="$(uuidgen)"
# Build the image
$ docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile -t "$REPO:$TAG"
# Load the image onto the Kind nodes
$ kind load docker-image "$REPO:$TAG"
# Deploy
$ helm upgrade secret-operator deploy/helm/secret-operator --install --set-string "image.repository=$REPO,image.tag=$TAG"
```

### Nix

To build and deploy to the active Kind cluster, run:

```bash
# Ensure that all submodules are up-to-date
$ git submodule update --recursive --init
# Ensure that the Cargo.lock is up-to-date
# This is not required if you use a tool that invokes Cargo regularly anyway, such as Rust-Analyzer
$ cargo generate-lockfile
# Use [crate2nix](https://github.com/kolloch/crate2nix) to convert Cargo.lock into a Nix derivation
$ nix run -f . crate2nix generate 
# Build the Docker images
$ nix build -f . docker
# Load the images onto the Kind nodes
# Nix does not use the Docker daemon, instead it builds individual layers, as well as a script (`result/load-image`) that combines them into a Docker image archive
$ kind load image-archive <(./result/load-image)
# Deploy
$ kubectl apply -f result/crds.yaml -f provisioner.yaml
$ kubectl rollout restart ds/secret-provisioner
```

You may need to add `extra-experimental-features = nix-command` to `/etc/nix/nix.conf`, or add `--experimental-features nix-command` to the Nix commands.

You can also use [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) to automatically recompile and redeploy when files are changed: `nix run -f . tilt up`.

### K3d

Secret-Operator, as with most CSI providers, requires the Kubernetes node's root folder to be mounted as `rshared`. K3d does not do this by default,
but can be prodded into doing this by running `mount --make-rshared /` in each node container.

To do this for each running node, run `for i in $(k3d node list -o json | jq -r .[].name); docker exec -it $i mount --make-rshared /; end`.
This is _not_ persistent, and must be re-executed every time the cluster (or a node in it) is restarted.

## Usage

The operator injects secret data into `Pod` `Volume`s that declare a CSI volume with the `driver` `secrets.stackable.tech`.
The volume takes the following mandatory attributes:

- `secrets.stackable.tech/class`: The type of secret to be issued. This corresponds to a `SecretClass` object.
- `secrets.stackable.tech/scope`: The properties of the `Pod` that the secret should authenticate. Supported options:
  - `node`
  - `pod`
  - `service=<foo>`
  - Multiple scopes may be defined, they should be separated by commas
  
A minimal secret-consuming `Pod` looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-secret-consumer
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: secret
    csi:
      driver: secrets.stackable.tech
      volumeAttributes:
        secrets.stackable.tech/class: tls
        secrets.stackable.tech/scope: node,pod,service=secret-consumer-nginx
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu
    image: ubuntu
    stdin: true
    tty: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: tls
      mountPath: /tls
```

`SecretClass` defines where the secrets come from. For example, the following `SecretClass`
issues TLS certificates, storing its CA certificate in `secret-provisioner-tls-ca`:

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SecretClass
metadata:
  name: tls
spec:
  backend:
    autoTls:
      ca:
        secret:
          name: secret-provisioner-tls-ca
          namespace: default
```

`SecretClass`'s `spec` accepts the following options:

- `backend`: The source of the secret data, exactly ONE variant may be used
  - `autoTls`: Automatically provisions certificates
    - `ca`: Configures the certificate authority used
      - `secret`: Reference (`name` and `namespace`) to a K8s `Secret` object where the CA certificate and key is stored as `ca.crt` and `ca.key` respectively
  - `k8sSearch`: Searches for a K8s `Secret` object that has labels matching the scopes specified on the volume (prefixed with `secrets.stackable.tech/`)
    - `searchNamespace`: The namespace where the `Secret`s should be located, exactly ONE variant may be used
      - `pod`: Searches in the same namespace where the `Pod` is located
        - (empty object)
      - `name`: Searches in the specified namespace
    - `secretLabels`: Extra labels (and values) that should be present on the `Secret` for it to be considered a match
