## What does it do?

The Secret Operator provisions and mounts secrets, but unlike the default Kubernetes Secret mechanism, Secrets can be created and mounted dynamically based on Pod properties. The Operator supports:

- Generating TLS certificates on demand and mounting them

## How it works

The Secret Operator is deployed as a DaemonSet and provides a CSI to mount files directly into Pods.
