= Secret Scope

Secrets often cover some specific aspect of a workload. For example:

* A Kerberos credential may be bound to one node IP
* An internal TLS certificate's `subjectAlternateName` section must match the `Pod`'s name and service

To solve this, the Stackable Secret Operator has a concept of "scopes", which allow a `Pod` to opt into including this
extra information. The exact impact of the scope depends on which xref:secretclass.adoc#backend[`backend`] is used.

[#node]
== `node`

The `node` scope is resolved to the name of the Kubernetes `Node` object that the `Pod` is running on. This will typically
be the DNS name of the node.

[#pod]
== `pod`

The `pod` scope is resolved to the name of the Kubernetes `Pod`. This allows the secret to differentiate between `StatefulSet` replicas.

[#service]
== `service`

The `service` scope allows `Pod` objects to specify custom scopes. This should typically correspond to `Service` objects that the
`Pod` participate in.
