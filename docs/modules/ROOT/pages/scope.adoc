= Scope

Secrets often cover some specific aspect of a workload. For example:

* A Kerberos credential may be bound to one node IP
* An internal TLS certificate's `subjectAlternateName` section must match the `Pod` object's name and service

To solve this, the Stackable Secret Operator has a concept of "scopes", which allow a xref:volume.adoc[] to selectively
include this extra context. The exact effect of the scope depends on which xref:secretclass.adoc#backend[`backend`] is used.

== Supported Scopes

[#node]
=== `node`

The `node` scope is resolved to the name of the Kubernetes `Node` object that the `Pod` is running on. This will typically
be the DNS name of the node.

[#pod]
=== `pod`

The `pod` scope is resolved to the name of the Kubernetes `Pod`. This allows the secret to differentiate between `StatefulSet` replicas.

[#service]
=== `service`

The `service` scope allows `Pod` objects to specify custom scopes. This should typically correspond to `Service` objects that the
`Pod` participate in.

== Example

For example, a TLS certificate provisioned by the xref:secretclass.adoc#backend-autotls[`autoTls`] backend, with the scopes
xref:#node[] and xref:#pod[] would contain the following values in its `subjectAlternateName` (SAN) extension field:

- The node's IP address
- The node's fully qualified domain name (`my-node.example.com`)
- The pod's fully qualified domain name (`my-pod.my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`)
