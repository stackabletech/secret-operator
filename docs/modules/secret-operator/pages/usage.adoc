= Usage

The operator injects secret data into xref:volume.adoc[] mounts that declare an ephemeral volume with `storageClassName: secrets.stackable.tech`.

NOTE: This page is only relevant for developers deploying their own Pods. Users deploying a Stackable Data Platform xref:concepts:stacklet.adoc[stacklet] should use the stacklet's secret class field instead.

A minimal secret-consuming Pod looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-pod.yaml[]
----

xref:secretclass.adoc[] defines where the secrets come from.
For example, the following SecretClass issues TLS certificates, storing its CA certificate in the Kubernetes Secret object named `secret-provisioner-tls-ca`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-secretclass-tls.yaml[]
----

NOTE: The default CA lifetime is https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator/blob/77e51cde89987239ab5cb303b0ffab051060e58c/rust/operator-binary/src/backend/tls/mod.rs#L44-L46[365 days].
This will be reduced over time.
