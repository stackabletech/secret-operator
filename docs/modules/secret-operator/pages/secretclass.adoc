= SecretClass
:description: A SecretClass in Kubernetes defines secret categories, handling certificate provision and secret management via multiple backends.
:cert-manager: https://cert-manager.io/

A _SecretClass_ is a cluster-global Kubernetes resource that defines a source of credentials that the Secret Operator knows how to provision.

This is intended to provide an abstraction between how the secret is used ("I need a certificate for my cluster's TLS PKI"),
and the policy for how it is provisioned (automatically and generated by the operator's internal CA, provisioned by the cluster administrator, or provisioned by an external service such as Hashicorp Vault).

A SecretClass looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$secretclass-tls.yaml[]
----
<1> Backends are mutually exclusive, only one may be used by each SecretClass
<2> Configures and selects the xref:#backend-autotls[] backend
<3> Configures and selects the xref:#backend-k8ssearch[] backend
<4> Provides a trust root to be requested by xref:truststore.adoc[]

[#backend]
== Backend

Each SecretClass is a associated with a single backend, which dictates the mechanism for issuing that kind of secret.

[#backend-autotls]
=== `autoTls`

*Format*: xref:#format-tls-pem[]

*TrustStore*: Yes

Issues a TLS certificate signed by the Secret Operator.
The certificate authority can be provided by the administrator, or managed automatically by the Secret Operator.

A new certificate and key pair will be generated and signed for each Pod, keys or certificates are never reused.

CAUTION: Attributes of the certificate (such as the expiration date, fingerprint, or serial number) will be regenerated for each
         Pod, and should not be expected to be stable.

xref:scope.adoc[Scopes] are used to populate the claims (such as `subjectAlternateName`) of the provisioned certificates.

[#backend-tls-certificate-key-pair-generation]
==== `TLS certificate key pair generation`

Currently, only RSA is supported in the `autoTls` backend.
You can however configure the key length for generated private keys. If not specified it will default to `2048` bits.

----
include::example$secretclass-tls-key-length.yaml[]
----
<1> `autoTls.ca.keyGeneration` specifies which algorithm and additional parameters are used
<2> `autoTls.ca.keyGeneration.rsa` specifies the RSA key pair algorithm (RSA currently is the only one supported)
<3> `autoTls.ca.keyGeneration.rsa.length` specifies the amount of bits used for generating the RSA key pair. Currently, `2048`, `3072` and `4096` are supported. Defaults to `2048` bits.

CAUTION
====
Using more than `2048` bits will significantly increase the computation time to create new key pairs.
The SSL Labs https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices[SSL and TLS Deployment Best Practices] as of 2024-10-01 recommend

>  For most websites, using RSA keys stronger than 2,048 bits and ECDSA keys stronger than 256 bits is a waste of CPU power and might impair user experience

If options higher than `2048` are chosen, the CPU resources for the secret operator should be increased in order to avoid Pods being stuck in `Pending` waiting for the computation of their key pair.
====

==== Certificate lifetime

By default the Secret Operator will generally aim to use as short-lived certificates as possible.
Short lifetime periods require frequent restarts of services, which may be totally unnoticeable for some products,
annoying for others or fatal for products with a single point of failure and no recovery from outages (e.g. Trino coordinator).

This choice was made deliberately after a considerate amount of time was spent thinking about this issue.
The following compromises were made:

. To enforce security constraints, cluster administrators can set a maximum allowed certificate lifetime on the SecretClass issuing the certificates (defaults to `15d`).
. The certificate lifetime is `24h`.
. Pods consuming the certificate can request a longer lifetime or shutdown expiration buffer via annotations
  on the xref:volume.adoc[Volume]. If they request a longer lifetime than the SecretClass allows,
  it will be shortened to the maximum allowed lifetime.
. To avoid stampeding herds during restarts and spread out the load, certificate durations are lowered by up to 20%.
. The Pods will be evicted `6h` before the certificate expires, to ensure that no Pods are left running with expired secrets.
  Consumers can override this buffer using Volume annotations.
  This buffer must be long enough that the product is guaranteed to gracefully shut down.

Most Stackable product operators will not set any specific certificate lifetime, so the default applies.
In case an operator sets a higher lifetime, a tracking issue must be created to document and track the steps to reduce the certificate lifetime.

Users can use xref:concepts:overrides.adoc#pod-overrides[podOverrides] to extend the certificate lifetime by adding volume annotations.
Native support for customizing certificate lifetimes in Stacklet CRDs might be added in the future.

==== Certificate Authority rotation

Certificate authorities also have a limited lifetime, and need to be rotated before they expire to avoid cluster disruption.

If configured to provision its own CA (`autoTls.ca.autoGenerate`), the Secret Operator will create CA certificates that are valid for 365 days (â‰ƒ 1 year, configurable via `autoTls.ca.caCertificateLifetime`), and initiate rotation once less than half of that time remains.

To avoid disruption and let the new CA propagate through the cluster, the Secret Operator will prefer using the oldest CA that will last for the entire lifetime of the issued certificate.

NOTE: Expired CA certificates will currently not be deleted automatically.
They should be cleaned up manually.

[#backend-certmanager]
=== `experimentalCertManager`

*Format*: xref:#format-tls-pem[]

*TrustStore*: No

Injects a TLS certificate issued by {cert-manager}[Cert-Manager].

WARNING: This backend is experimental, and subject to change.

NOTE: This backend requires {cert-manager}[Cert-Manager] to already be installed and configured.

A new certificate will be requested the first time it is used by a Pod, it will be reused after that (subject to Cert-Manager's renewal rules).

Node-scoped requests will cause a Pod to become "sticky" to the Node that it was first scheduled to (like xref:#backend-k8ssearch[], but unlike xref:#backend-autotls[]).

[#backend-kerberoskeytab]
=== `kerberosKeytab`

*Format*: xref:#format-kerberos[]

*TrustStore*: No

Creates a Kerberos keytab file for a selected realm. The Kerberos KDC and administrator credentials must be provided by the administrator.

IMPORTANT: Only MIT Kerberos (krb5) and Active Directory are currently supported.
Heimdal is not supported.

Principals will be created dynamically if they do not already exist.

The administrator keytab must have permission to add principals and get their keys. This corresponds to the flags `ae` in `kadm5.acl`.

==== Active Directory

[#ad-principal-conflicts]
===== Principal Conflicts

Each Active Directory domain should be used by only a single Kubernetes cluster.

This is because each pod, service, and node may be provisioned a principal matching its hostname, and principal names must be unique within a single AD domain.
The Stackable Secret Operator will cache and reuse these credentials within a single Kubernetes cluster, but will not share them across multiple clusters.

If the same AD domain _is_ shared between multiple Kubernetes clusters, the following _must_ be unique across the AD domain:

* The Kubernetes Nodes' names and fully qualified domain names
* The Kubernetes Namespaces' names (only Namespaces that use Kerberos)

[#ad-acl]
===== Access Control

The Secret Operator needs permission to create users in the configured base container
(`kerberosKeytab.admin.activeDirectory.userDistinguishedName`), as well as to reset their passwords.

The easiest way to configure this is to run the following PowerShell script:

// FIXME: This script is copied from ad-init, can we share this somehow?

[source,powershell]
----
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
# Change these variables to fit your environment
$ou_path = "AD:OU=SDP,DC=sble,DC=test"
$secretop = [System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]::New("S-1-5-21-1256652973-2063416196-3566311115-1103")

$acl = Get-ACL -Path $ou_path
$user_schema_guid = "bf967aba-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2"
$password_reset_right_guid = "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529"
$ou_create_children_rule = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule]::New(
  $secretop,
  [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights]::CreateChild,
  [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]::Allow,
  $user_schema_guid,
  [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurityInheritance]::None
)
$ou_reset_passwords_rule = [System.DirectoryServices.ExtendedRightAccessRule]::New(
  $secretop,
  [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]::Allow,
  $password_reset_right_guid,
  [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurityInheritance]::Children
)
$acl.AddAccessRule($ou_create_children_rule)
$acl.AddAccessRule($ou_reset_passwords_rule)
Set-ACL -Path $ou_path -AclObject $acl
----

NOTE: The "reset passwords" rule created by the script will show up as applying no permissions in ADSI Edit.
      This is because ADSI Edit is unaware of the extended right that it grants. The rule _should not_ be
      deleted or modified manually, or the operator will break. If the rule has been tampered with, run the
      script again to fix the problem.

Alternatively, it can be configured manually using the graphical "ADSI Edit" tool. Secret Operator's user needs two permission rules
on the base container:

- On the container itself: Create User objects
- On descendants of the container: Reset Password (this is not visible in the GUI, but is granted by the "All extended rights" toggle)


[#ad-samaccountname]
===== Custom `samAccountName` generation

IMPORTANT: `samAccountName` customization is an experimental preview feature, and may be changed or removed at any time.

By default, the `samAccountName` for created Active Directory accounts will be generated by Active Directory.

These can be customized if required, such as for compliance with internal policies. When customization is enabled,
the name will follow the pattern `\{prefix}\{random}`, where `\{random}` is a sequence of random alphanumeric characters.
The full name will be exactly `totalLength` characters.

For example, the following configuration will generate samAccountNames such as "myprefix-abcd".

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  backend:
    kerberosKeytab:
      admin:
        activeDirectory:

            totalLength: 13
----

`kerberosKeytab.admin.activeDirectory.experimentalGenerateSamAccountName.prefix`:: A prefix that will be prepended to all generated `samAccountName` values.
`kerberosKeytab.admin.activeDirectory.experimentalGenerateSamAccountName.totalLength`:: The desired length of `samAccountName` values, _including_ `prefix`. Must not be larger than 20.

NOTE: These options only affect _newly created_ accounts. Existing accounts will keep their respective old `samAccountName`.

[#backend-k8ssearch]
=== `k8sSearch`

*Format*: Free-form

*TrustStore*: If configured

This backend can be used to mount `Secret` across namespaces into pods. The `Secret` object is selected based on two things:

1. The xref:scope.adoc[scopes] specified on the `Volume` using the attribute `secrets.stackable.tech/scope`.
2. The label `secrets.stackable.tech/class` specified in the `Secret` it's self. This must match the name of the `SecretClass`.

Each field in this `Secret` is mapped to one file. It is suggested these `Secret` objects should follow one of the xref:#format[formats defined in this document].

In the example below, given the three object definitions for a `Pod`, a `SecretClass` and a `Secret`, the operator will first read the Pod's volume attributes then look up the secret class. The `k8sSearch` backend will look up the Secret object labeled with `secrets.stackable.tech/class: admin-credentials-class` (the name of the secret class) and mount the fields of the Secret as files into the container at the specified mount point (`/credentials`).
Please note that the contents in the volume will not update when the Secret content changes. A Pod restart is needed to refresh the Secret contents on disk.

`k8sSearch.trustStoreConfigMapName`:: ConfigMap used to provision xref:truststore.adoc[].

==== Format

The `k8sSearch` backend doesn't use a particular format, since the underlying `Secret` may contain any kind of free-form data.
If a specific format is xref:volume.adoc#volume-attr-format[requested] then the source format of the secret is inferred
(based on the keys present in the secret), and a conversion is performed if required.

NOTE: If a format is requested then only the keys relevant to the format will be mounted. For example, given a secret containing the files `ca.crt`,
`tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and `tls.config`, the `tls.config` key will be projected to a file if no format is requested, but not if the xref:#format-tls-pem[]
format is requested.

[#format]
== Format

A format describes a set of artifacts (files and their respective contents) produced by a backend.

Each backend should conform to at least one common format. This is intended to allow cluster operators to switch between interoperable backends with
minimal impact on secret consumers.

[#format-tls-pem]
=== [[format-tls]]TLS (PEM)

*Name*: `tls-pem`

The secret contains the following files:

`ca.crt`:: The certificate of the Certificate Authority (and associated chain) that has signed the certificate, in the PEM format.
`tls.crt`:: The certificate identifying the `Pod`, in the PEM format.
`tls.key`:: The private key corresponding to `tls.crt`, in the PEM format.

A TLS secret can also be xref:volume.adoc#volume-attr-format[converted] into xref:#format-tls-pkcs12[].

[#format-tls-pkcs12]
=== TLS (PKCS#12)

*Name*: `tls-pkcs12`

The secret contains the following files:

`keystore.p12` :: A bundle of the private key and certificate (including the CA certificates), in the PKCS#12 format.
`truststore.p12` :: A bundle of trusted CA certificates, in the PKCS#12 format.

Both stores are encrypted, with an empty string as the passphrase.

NOTE: When using the xref:#backend-k8ssearch[] backend, it is _strongly_ recommended to store secrets in the use the xref:#format-tls-pem[] format instead.
The secret operator supports converting PEM key pairs into PKCS#12, but not the other way around.

[#format-kerberos]
=== Kerberos

*Name*: `kerberos`

The secret contains the following files:

`krb5.conf`:: Kerberos configuration file for authenticating against the Kerberos realm.
`keytab`:: A Kerberos keytab file containing credentials for all requested principals.
