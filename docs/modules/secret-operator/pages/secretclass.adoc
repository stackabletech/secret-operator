= `SecretClass`

A `SecretClass` is a cluster-global Kubernetes resource that defines a category of secrets that the Secret Operator knows how to provision.

This is intended to provide an abstraction between how the secret is used ("I need a certificate for my cluster's TLS PKI") and how
it is provisioned (automatically and generated by the operator's internal CA, provisioned by the cluster administrator, or provisioned by an
external service such as Hashicorp Vault).

A `SecretClass` looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$secretclass-tls.yaml[]
----
<1> Backends are mutually exclusive, only one may be used by each `SecretClass`
<2> Configures and selects the xref:#backend-autotls[] backend
<3> Configures and selects the xref:#backend-k8ssearch[] backend

[#backend]
== Backend

Each `SecretClass` is a associated with a single backend, which dictates the mechanism for issuing that kind of secret.

[#backend-autotls]
=== `autoTls`

*Format*: xref:#format-tls[]

Issues a TLS certificate signed by the Secret Operator. The certificate authority can be provided by the administrator, or managed automatically
by the Secret Operator.

A new certificate and keypair will be generated and signed for each `Pod`, keys or certificates are never reused.

CAUTION: Attributes of the certificate (such as the expiration date, fingerprint, or serial number) will be regenerated for each
         `Pod`, and should not be expected to be stable.

xref:scope.adoc[Scopes] are used to populate the claims (such as `subjectAlternateName`) of the provisioned certificates.

        autoGenerate: true
----

`autoTls`:: Declares that the `autoTls` backend is used.
`autoTls.ca`:: Configures the certificate authority used to issue `Pod` certificates.
`autoTls.ca.secret`:: Reference (`name` and `namespace`) to a K8s `Secret` object where the CA certificate and key is stored in the keys `ca.crt`
                      and `ca.key` respectively.
`autoTls.ca.autoGenerate`:: Whether the certificate authority should be provisioned if it can not be found.

[#backend-kerberoskeytab]
=== `kerberosKeytab`

*Format*: xref:#format-kerberos[]

Creates a Kerberos keytab file for a selected realm. The Kerberos KDC and administrator credentials must be provided by the administrator.

IMPORTANT: Only MIT Kerberos (krb5) is supported. Heimdal and Active Directory are not supported.

Principals will be created dynamically if they do not already exist.

The administrator keytab must have permission to add principals and get their keys. This corresponds to the flags `ae` in `kadm5.acl`.

----

`kerberosKeytab`:: Declares that the `kerberosKeytab` backend is used.
`kerberosKeytab.realmName`:: The name of the Kerberos realm. This should be provided by the Kerberos administrator.
`kerberosKeytab.kdc`:: The hostname of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). This should be provided by the Kerberos administrator.
`kerberosKeytab.admin.mit.kadminServer`:: The hostname of the Kerberos Admin Server. This should be provided by the Kerberos administrator.
`kerberosKeytab.adminKeytabSecret`:: Reference (`name` and `namespace`) to a K8s `Secret` object where a keytab with administrative privileges is stored in the key `keytab`.
`kerberosKeytab.adminPrincipal`:: The name of the Kerberos principal to be used by the Secret Operator. This should be provided by the Kerberos administrator. The credentials for this principal must be stored in the keytab (`adminKeytabSecret`).

[#backend-k8ssearch]
=== `k8sSearch`

*Format*: Free-form

A Kubernetes `Secret` object is selected based on the xref:scope.adoc[scopes] specified on the `Volume`. Each field in this `Secret` is mapped
to one file. It is suggested these `Secret` objects should follow one of the xref:#format[formats defined in this document].

xref:scope.adoc[Scopes] are translated into additional label filters of the form `secrets.stackable.tech/$SCOPE: $SCOPE_VALUE`.
For example, a `Pod` named `foo` mounting a `k8sSearch` secret with the xref:scope.adoc#pod[`pod`] scope would add the label filter
`secrets.stackable.tech/pod: foo`.

----

`k8sSearch`:: Declares that the `k8sSearch` backend is used.
`k8sSearch.searchNamespace`:: Configures the namespace searched for `Secret` objects.
`k8sSearch.searchNamespace.pod`:: The `Secret` objects are located in the same namespace as the `Pod` object. Should be used
                                  for secrets that are provisioned by the application administrator.
`k8sSearch.searchNamespace.name`:: The `Secret` objects are located in a single global namespace. Should be used for secrets
                                   that are provisioned by the cluster administrator.

[#format]
== Format

A format describes a set of artifacts (files and their respective contents) produced by a backend.

Each backend should conform to at least one common format. This is intended to allow cluster operators to switch between interoperable backends with
minimal impact on secret consumers.

[#format-tls]
=== TLS

The secret contains the following files:

`ca.crt`:: The certificate of the Certificate Authority (and associated chain) that has signed the certificate, in the PEM format.
`tls.crt`:: The certificate identifying the `Pod`, in the PEM format.
`tls.key`:: The private key corresponding to `tls.crt`, in the PEM format.

[#format-kerberos]
=== Kerberos

The secret contains the following files:

`krb5.conf`:: Kerberos configuration file for authenticating against the Kerberos realm.
`keytab`:: A Kerberos keytab file containing credentials for all requested principals.
