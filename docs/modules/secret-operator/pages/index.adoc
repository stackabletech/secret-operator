This is an operator for Kubernetes that provisions and injects secrets into Kubernetes Pods.

Kubernetes Secret objects contain sensitive payloads such as passwords, tokens or keys.
These objects are usually self-contained and static in the sense that their contents remain unchanged as long as their owners do not update them.

The Stackable Secret Operator enhances the functionality of Kubernetes Secrets by introducing the concept of a SecretClass.
A SecretClass represents a reference to a source of sensitive data.
In addition to Kubernetes Secret objects, the operator can provision Pods with TLS Certificates, Kerberos keytabs or authentication tokens from external services.
