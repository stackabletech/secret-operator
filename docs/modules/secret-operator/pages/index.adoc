= Stackable Secret Operator

This is an operator for Kubernetes that provisions and injects secrets into Kubernetes Pods.

Kubernetes `Secret` objects contain sensitive payloads such as passwords, tokens or keys. These objects
are usually self-contained and static in the sense that their contents remain unchanged as long as their owners
do not update them.

The Stackable Secret Operator enhances the functionality of Kubernetes Secrets by introducing the concept of a
`SecretClass`. A `SecretClass` represents a reference to a source of sensitive data. In addition to Kubernetes
`Secret` objects, the operator can provision Pods with TLS Certificates, Kerberos keytabs or authentication
tokens from external services.
