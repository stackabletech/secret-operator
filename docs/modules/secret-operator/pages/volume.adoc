= Volume

The primary entry point for applications is by mounting a secret into a `Pod` object's `volume` set. This is done by using Kubernetes'
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#ephemeralvolumesource-v1-core[`EphemeralVolumeSource`] type.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$volume-pod.yaml[]
----
<1> This secret is provided by the xref:secretclass.adoc[] named `tls`
<2> This secret should be xref:scope.adoc[scoped] by the intersection of xref:scope.adoc#node[`node`], xref:scope.adoc#pod[`pod`], and the xref:scope.adoc#service[`service`] named `secret-consumer`
<3> Tells Kubernetes that the Stackable Secret Operator is responsible for mounting this volume
<4> Kubernetes requires us to specify some boilerplate settings for a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to be well-formed
<5> The injected volume can then be mounted into a container, just like any other volume. In this example, the secrets are provided in the `/tls` directory of the container.

NOTE: Only ephemeral volumes are supported, the Secret Operator does *not* support declaring standalone `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects.

*Required*: false

*Default value*: no scopes

*Backends*: All

The xref:scope.adoc[scopes] used to select or provision the secret. Multiple scopes should be separated by commas (`,`), and scope parameters are separated by equals signs (`=`) where applicable.
